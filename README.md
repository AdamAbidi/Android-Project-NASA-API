# Android-Project-NASA-API

My team developped a mobile application for space amateurs.
Our project offers three separate services.

The first: called APOD ,displays the photo of the day taken by the satellites.

The second: Earth imagery which displays images of the earth at a specific date and a longitude and latitude chosen by the user.

The third: the most ambitious of the three, called Mars Rover Photos, allows you to view the images captured by the robots sent by NASA to Mars.

We implemeted the project using Android Studio
